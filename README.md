# Flappy Bird With Neural Network Policy

This is a simple implementation of Flappy Bird using gym Environment and a Neural Network Policy. The Neural Network Policy is trained using the Genetic Algorithm and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The Genetic Algorithm is used to select the best Neural Network Policy from a population of Neural Network Policies. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to train the Neural Network Policy with Policy Gradient methods. 

We will to train with both methods and will compare the results. Our objective is to train the Neural Network Policy to play Flappy Bird for as long as possible, in other words, to get the highest score and never die!
